Initiate the the sensors using native Xiaomi Home App. Then extract BLE KEY using i.e.: https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/Xiaomi-cloud-tokens-extractor.
You should get BLE KEY value for every sensor already activated like follows:
<code>
...
BLE KEY:  1daa6055aa6fc2e17abddab555d63c78
MAC:      A4:C1:38:D4:75:50
...
</code>
BLE KEY is neccessary for decryption BLE Advertisement messages (the most power saving mode) simply try to start with your IDs in losobleadvtomqtt.py.
Another approach is to use expect script on top of bluetoothctl losonewble.sh (instead of usual gatttool) and read actively data from BLE MAC Address...
Enjoy...
