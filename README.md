Initiate the the sensors using native Xiaomi Home App. Then extract BLE KEY using i.e.: https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/Xiaomi-cloud-tokens-extractor.
You should get BLE KEY value for every sensor already activated like follows:
<code>
...
BLE KEY:  1daa6055aa6fc2e17abddab555d63c78
MAC:      A4:C1:38:D4:75:50
...
</code>
BLE KEY is neccessary for decryption BLE Advertisement messages (the most power saving mode).
Another approach is to use expect script upon bluetoothctl (instead of usual gatttool) and read actively data from BLE MAC Address...
Enjoy...
